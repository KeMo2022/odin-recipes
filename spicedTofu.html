            <li>1 (16 ounce) package extra-firm tofu, drained and pressed</li>
            <li>2 cups vegetable broth</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons vegetable oil</li>
            <li>1/2 cup all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons nutritional yeast</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>

            <li>1 teaspoon sage</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon cayenne pepper</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Steps</h4>
        <ol>
            <li><em>Step 1</em></li>
            <p> Cut pressed tofu into 1/2-inch thick slices; then cut again into
                1/2-inch wide sticks. Place tofu in a bowl, and pour broth over the top.
                Set aside to soak.
            </p>
            <li><em>Step 2</em></li>
            <p>In a seperate bowl, stir together flour, yeast, salt, pepper, sage, and cayenne.</p>
            <li>Step 3</li>
            <p>Warm oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat.</p>
            <li><em>Step 4</em></li>
            <p> Remove tofu sticks from broth, and squeeze most (but not all) of the liquid from them.
                Roll sticks in breading.(You may have to roll sticks twice to end up with a fairly dry outer layer
                of breading.)Place tofu in hot oil; fry until crisp and browned on all sides. Add more oil if necessary.
            </p>
