# odin-recipes
In this project I am going to create a simple recipe website.
Nothing fancy about this project, just some basics of HTML.
This project will help me put together all the basic knowledge about HTML that I have learned so far from the Odin Project Curriculum.
So far I have learned how to display information on the web using HTML.
I learned how to display headings, links, images, lists and paragraphs.
I have also learned how to save my work using Git and displaying it on GitHub through the command line.
