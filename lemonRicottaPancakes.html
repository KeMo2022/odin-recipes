            <p>Whisk water and baking soda together in a mixing bowl. Add ricotta cheese,

            <p>Let batter sit at room temperature for about 15 minutes.</p>
            <li>Step 3</li>

                Portion out 1/4 cup scoops of batter onto skillet (cook in batches). 
                When bubbles begin to form on the surface and the edges of the pancakes start to look dry
                (2 to 3 minutes), flip and cook other side until cooked through, 2 to 3 minutes.
